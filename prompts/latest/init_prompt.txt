We are in a US midwestern township of half a million inhabitants. 
		A large river flows through this township which is also fed by a large
		watershed in which the township is located. There is forecast for very heavy
		rain and possibility of flooding at large scale. Consider that the
		probability of flooding is 90%. The township needs to make anticipatory
		decision to respond to the impending event to minimize the impact of 
		floods but also keep in mind the needs of the community which relies on the
		river water. A reservoir downstream of the town supports potable water needs,
		provide energy, and recreational needs. The river also supports navigational
		and commercial traffic. Decisions regarding the management of reservoir
		levels is part of the decision variables available. At the end of the
		conversation, a strategy needs to be developed to manage to outcome of the
		floods keeping in mind uncertainty of the event, noting that different
		probabilities of risks may justifiy different approaches.
